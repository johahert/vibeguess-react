## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A music lover wants to test their music knowledge by creating and taking interactive quizzes that play Spotify tracks during gameplay. They authenticate via Spotify to access their premium features and control playback on their preferred devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm a new user, **When** I visit the VibeGuess application, **Then** I can authenticate with my Spotify account and access quiz features
2. **Given** I'm authenticated, **When** I create a quiz with a custom prompt, **Then** the system generates relevant music questions with audio previews
3. **Given** I have a Spotify Premium account, **When** I take a quiz, **Then** I can control music playback on my connected Spotify devices
4. **Given** I complete a quiz, **When** I view my results, **Then** I see my score, correct answers, and can review my quiz history
5. **Given** I want to retake quizzes, **When** I access my quiz history, **Then** I can replay previous quizzes or create new ones

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Spotify authentication expires during quiz gameplay?
- How does the system handle users without Spotify Premium (no device control)?
- What occurs when no Spotify devices are available for playback?
- How does the application behave with slow network connections during audio streaming?
- What happens when quiz generation fails or returns incomplete data?
