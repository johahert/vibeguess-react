**Structure Decision**: Frontend SPA with modern React patterns and TypeScript

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Vite+React+TypeScript optimal configuration patterns
   - ShadCN/UI integration with custom theming and accessibility
   - Spotify Web Playback SDK integration patterns  
   - TanStack Query setup for API state management
   - Authentication flow implementation with secure token storage

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Vite+React+TypeScript project setup best practices for 2025"
   Task: "Find ShadCN/UI integration patterns with TailwindCSS and accessibility"
   Task: "Research Spotify Web Playback SDK implementation in React applications"
   Task: "Find TanStack Query patterns for authentication and real-time data"
   Task: "Research secure token storage and OAuth PKCE flow in browser SPAs"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User entity with Spotify profile and preferences
   - Quiz entity with questions and metadata
   - QuizSession entity for active gameplay
   - Device entity for Spotify playback control
   - PlaybackState entity for real-time status

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Authentication contract (login, callback, refresh, profile)
   - Quiz management contract (generate, fetch, history)
   - Playback control contract (devices, play, pause, status)
   - Error handling and retry logic contracts
   - Output TypeScript interfaces to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Mock API responses using MSW (Mock Service Worker)
   - One test file per API endpoint category
   - Assert request/response schemas and error handling
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - OAuth authentication flow E2E test
   - Quiz creation and taking integration test
   - Spotify device selection and playback test
   - Token refresh and error recovery test

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
   - Add React+TypeScript+Vite+TailwindCSS tech stack info
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → TypeScript interface and hook task [P] 
- Each user story → E2E test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass (components, services, pages)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Types → Services → Components → Pages → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - no complexity justification needed*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)

- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
