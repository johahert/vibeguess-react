# VibeGuess Frontend Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**TDD is mandatory for all code**: Tests MUST be written first, approved by stakeholders, 
MUST fail initially, then implementation follows. Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly 
enforced. No code commits allowed without corresponding tests. Contract tests are 
required for all API endpoints and component interfaces. Integration tests MUST validate 
complete user scenarios before feature acceptance.

### II. Code Quality Standards
**Maintainability over cleverness**: All code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming 
conventions. Static analysis tools (linting, type checking) are mandatory and MUST pass 
before commits. Code reviews are required for all changes. Maximum function complexity 
limited to 10 cyclomatic complexity. Dependencies MUST be justified and documented. 
Technical debt tracking is mandatory with remediation plans.

### III. User Experience Excellence
**User-centric design drives all decisions**: Every feature MUST solve a real user problem 
with measurable success criteria. UI/UX consistency enforced through design system 
components. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) is non-negotiable. Mobile-responsive design 
required for all interfaces. User flows MUST be validated through usability testing 
before implementation. Error states and loading indicators are mandatory.

### IV. Continuous User Feedback
**Build with users, not assumptions**: User feedback collection mechanisms MUST be 
integrated into every feature. Analytics tracking is mandatory for all user interactions. 
A/B testing framework required for significant UI changes. User research sessions MUST 
occur before major feature development. Feedback loops MUST be closed within one sprint. 
User support channels integrated with development workflow.

### V. Performance Standards
**Speed is a feature**: Page load times MUST be under 3 seconds on 3G connections. 
Bundle size increases require justification and optimization plans. Performance budgets 
enforced in CI/CD pipeline. Real User Monitoring (RUM) required in production. Core Web 
Vitals MUST meet "Good" thresholds. Database queries optimized for sub-200ms response 
times. Caching strategies mandatory for repeated data access.

## Quality Assurance Framework

**Automated Quality Gates**: CI/CD pipeline MUST include automated testing, security 
scanning, performance benchmarking, and accessibility testing. No production deployments 
without passing all quality gates. Rollback procedures automated and tested. Feature 
flags required for gradual rollouts.

**Monitoring and Alerting**: Production monitoring covers performance metrics, error 
rates, user satisfaction scores, and business KPIs. Alert thresholds defined for all 
critical systems. On-call rotation established for production issues.

## Development Workflow

**Specification-Driven Development**: All features begin with detailed specifications 
approved by stakeholders. Implementation plans required before coding begins. Task 
breakdown follows constitutional principles. Progress tracking against specifications 
mandatory.

**Code Review Standards**: Two-reviewer minimum for production code. Constitutional 
compliance verified in every review. Security implications assessed. Performance 
impact evaluated.

## Governance

**Constitutional Authority**: This constitution supersedes all other development practices. 
Amendments require documented justification, stakeholder approval, and migration plan. 
All code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Complexity MUST be justified 
against constitutional principles.

**Continuous Improvement**: Constitution reviewed quarterly with development team. 
Metrics tracked for each principle's effectiveness. Process improvements based on 
data-driven decisions.
